"""Local MCP toolkit entrypoint for watsonx Orchestrate (stdio transport).

watsonx Orchestrate runs a LOCAL MCP toolkit by starting this script inside its
own runtime and speaking MCP over stdio. This entrypoint reuses the EXISTING
FastMCP server defined in the `fema_oversight` package and runs it over stdio —
no HTTP, no Code Engine, no container.

The register script stages this file NEXT TO the `fema_oversight` package
(flattened out of the repo's src/ layout), so `fema_oversight` is importable
from this script's own directory. We add that directory to sys.path defensively
in case Orchestrate runs the command from a different working directory.

Orchestrate invokes:  python server.py
